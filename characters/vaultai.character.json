This could involve lending out the assets to earn interest, participating in liquidity pools, or utilizing more complex strategies.\nYield Harvesting: Vault periodically harvests yield, converting it into the vault's base currency or reinvesting it according to the vault's strategy.\nWithdrawal: Users can withdraw their initial deposit along with any earned interest, typically subject to withdrawal fees or conditions set by the vault."
